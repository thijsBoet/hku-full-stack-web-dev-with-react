## Software frameworks?
- Abstraction in which software provides generic functionality that can be selectively changed by additional user-written code
- Universal, reusable environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform
- e.g. Angular

## Software Library
- Collection of implementations of behavior with a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked
- Reuse of behavior
- Modularity
- e.g. Jquery

## Framework vs Library
- A Library is a collection of functions. Your code is in charge and it calls into the Library when it sees fit.
- A particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in the details. The framework is in charge and it calls into the code when it needs something app specific.

## Framework
- Hollywood principle: Don't call us, we'll call you!
- Inversion of control
- Imperative vs Declarative programming

## What is React?
- A Javascript Library for building user interfaces
- Declarative
- Component based approach
- Technology stack agnostic
- Designed for Speed, Simplicity and Scalability
